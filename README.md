# Agri-Link
AgriLink is a full-stack web platform designed to connect farmers, buyers, and consumers directly â€” removing middlemen and ensuring fair pricing, transparency, and trust in agricultural trade. This project empowers Indian farmers by enabling them to list their crops, view real-time government prices, and sell directly to the customers nearby.
